# AntiAntiAdblock
Code to remove anti-adblock scripts from stopping you reading web content

For bookmarks:
Create a new bookmark anyway you want. I suggest on your browser toolbar.
Copy the content of bookmark.js as the url of the bookmark.
Click the bookmark whenever someone tries to stop you from using adblock.
